    <h2>True worth</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        True worth is in being, not seeming. In doing each
        day that goes by some little good. Not in dreaming,
        of great and great things to do by and by. Whatsoever,
        men think in their blindness, despite the follies of
        their youth, there is nothing so kingly, as loyalty.
        Nothing so kind as truthy.
    </p>

        It is better to keep your mouth closed and let people
        think you are a fool than to open it and remove all
        the doubt.
