        Innovation
        <ul>
            <li>Philosophy: We believe innovation happens when ideas
            can meet and mate.
            </li>
            <li>
                We believe there is immense latent potential in every
                student, staff, faculty member or anyone else. We strive
                to connect, enable and inspire members to become the best they are.
            </li>
            <li>
                We believe individual performance, <var>i</var> is amplified by
                <var>we</var>, thus <var>i</var><sup><var>we</var></sup>.
            </li>

        Entrepreneurship
        <ul>
            <li>
                We understand our responsibility to society. We are obliged
                to solve societal problems through innovative but impactful ways.
                Entrepreneurship is a means to taking solutions to society.
                We enable our members through incubation,
                acceleration, and mentorship programs. We believe entrepreneurship
                is a petri-dish to reiterating solutions, generating more innovative
                but impactful solutions. This has been evidenced by a long haul
                of founder companies in-born from our college: Mak-ers.
            </li>
            <li>
                The entrepreneur spirit is live in all our members and you too
                can be infected by this entrepreneurship bug.

        Technological Leadership
        <ul>
            <li>
                If innovation was a game, we don't play it according the rules we find.
                We break and make rules. We are not a bunch of me-toos. We comeup
                with innovative solutions that are not copy-and-paste. We are leaders and never
                burdened by trends and fad ideas.
