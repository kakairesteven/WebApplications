<blockquote cite="http://favoritepoem">
    True worth is in being, not seeming.<br>In doing, each day that goes by some
    little good.<br>Not in dreaming of great and great things to do by and by. <br>
    Whatsoever men think in their blindness, <br>in spite of the foolies
    of their youth, <br>there is nothing so kingly as truth and
    nothing so true as
    <del>kindness</del>
    <in>kind-ness</in>.
