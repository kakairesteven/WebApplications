            The street map on the left contains six regions surrounded by
            hidden boundary lines: Dam and Hydroelectric, Downtown Lawrence,
            East Lawrence Residential, East Lawrence Industrial, Old West
            Lawrence, and University of Kansas.

        <div>
            Moving the cursor from outside to inside one of these regions
            generates a pop-up box that identities the region just entered.
            Clicking within any region displays a representative image in
            the frame on the right.

<p class ="downtown">
    <span class="title">Downtown Lawrence</span> comprises about
    20 city blocks between South Park and the Kansas River.
    This area includes a county courthouse, an art center, a library,
    the city hall, offices, apartments, and two hotels. <span class="opportunity">
    It also has many parking lots and attached shops and restaurants with
    roofs of similar height that could accommodate solar connectors.</span>
</p>

<p class="eastLawrence">
    East of Downtown is an 80-block area called <span class="title">
    East Lawrence</span>. The Western half is residential with many small
    houses and a grade school. The eastern half is industrial, with
    manufacturing buildings, warehouses, a railroad station and tracks,
    open parking areas, a rock-crushing plant, and the city's sewage plant.
    <span class="opportunity">solar collectors could over parking
    areas and flat industrial roofs. With combined heat and power (CHP),
    this area's industry might also provide efficient heat and
    electricity for itself, adjacent residences, and the nearby downtown.
    </span>
</p>

<p class="westLawrence">
    West of downtown is an 80-block area called <span class="title">
    Old West of downtown</span>. the southern two-thirds is
    residential and includes a grade school. The northern third has
    several medical facilities with large parking lots, and there
    is some industrial land by railroad tracks at the north end.
    <span class="opportunity">Solar collectors could go on the school,
    medical, and industrial properties, and on residence roofs
    not obstructed by trees.</span>
</p>

<p class="ku">
    Southwest of Old West Lawrence is <span class="title">
    The University of Kansas</span>. Before switching to utility
    power around 1960, KU produced its own heat and electricity.
    <span class="opportunity">Solar collectors could cover many KU building
    roofs and parking lots. And KU could implement a robust renewable
    microgrid like the one at the university of California San Diego.</span>
