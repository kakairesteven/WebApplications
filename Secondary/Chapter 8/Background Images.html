    <h3>True Worth</h3>
    <p>
      True worth is in being, and not seeming. In doing each day that goes by
      some little good. Not in dreaming of great and greater things to do by and
      by. Whatsoever men think in their blindness, despite the follies of their
      youth, there is nothing so kingly as loyalty and nothing so kind as truth.
