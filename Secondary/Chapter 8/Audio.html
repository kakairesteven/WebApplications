<h2>She is crazy</h2>
<p>
    JT Coldfire has played professionally for over 15 of his 31 years
    from Texas to New York and across the pond in Europe.
    Throughout his career, JT has gained the reputation as one of the
    hardest working musicians in Austin, sometimes playing 3
    shows in a single evening never repeating the same song twice for
    over 9 hours of live performance. His travels all over the Texas
    Gulf Coast, Oklahoma, Tennessee, New York and as far off as Sweden,
    have gained an audience that is as dedicated to his performances
    as he is delivering them.
